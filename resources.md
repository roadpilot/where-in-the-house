1. Is the project required to be in two repositories or is it just important that the frontend is separated from the backend?
2. I haven't seen any project examples that have a user login - even the lab examples don't use a user.  If the project idea includes having a unique user, is it ok to just "imagine" that step and run the project as if a user was logged in?
3. Can you recommend any of the instruct videos for the js project?
adapters
slack: js-project-build: pinned 
4. Is there anything in the old videos that doesn't apply and should be avoided?
