# WhereInTheHouse[???]

## Description

Record where you put stuff so you, or someone else, can find it later.  If you don't know what something is called, just give it a description.  Change location of stuff and keep a history of `where you might find it`.  All information is editable and updateable.

## Install instructions

To use this app, just clone, run `bundle install` and run `rake db:create'.  You may have to install PostgreSQL.  Once the PostgreSQL database has been created, run `rake db:migrate'.  If you would like to use the seed data, run `rake db:seed`.  Then run `rails s`.  From the `frontend` directory, open the `index.html` file in your browser.  Everything should be set up.
